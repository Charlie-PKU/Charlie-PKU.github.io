<br>

Hello! Here is **Chen FANG (Charlie, 房晨)**.

I am a Ph.D. student majoring in **Applied Economics** at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Jing Cao](https://chinaproject.harvard.edu/people/jing-cao).

I am curious and passionate about public policy and global economic governance, especially climate change, sustainable development, and economic resilience. I hope to work for an international organization such as the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) or [Resources for the Future](https://www.rff.org/) to conduct valuable research.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at: 

*fangc23[at]mails[dot]tsinghua[dot]edu[dot]cn*.📍
