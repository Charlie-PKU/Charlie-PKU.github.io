- 🔆🔆Sep.2021 – Nov.2022: **Undergraduate Research of Peking University**

**Academic Advisor**: [Hancheng Dai](http://scholar.pku.edu.cn/hanchengdai) and [Yazhen Wu](https://iiasa.ac.at/staff/yazhen-wu)

**Research Topic**: Global biomass energy supply curve and its possible impact on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

<details>
  <summary>Summary: ⚓ </summary>

<br>

  `<font color='grey'>`This study quantitatively simulated the global biomass production cost under different demand and sustainable development constraint scenarios, plotted the biomass supply curve, and quantitatively analyzed the trade-off relationship between biomass production and sustainable development goals (SDGs) such as land management, food security and greenhouse gas emissions.`</font>`

</details>

<br>

**Conclusions**:

(a) Biomass energy has certain development space in the future, but it is faced with economic feasibility constraints.

(b) The production of biomass energy needs to pay attention to the competition and trade-off between raw material planting and food crops.
